						<p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Merlijn van Helm, but on the internet I'm more commonly known by one of the following:</p>
						<ul id="nicknames">
							<li>merren2306</li>
							<li>Treehee</li>
							<li>Treehearth</li>
							<li>TheWizardM</li>
							<li>DutchM</li>
						</ul>
						<p>I'm interested in a bunch of stuff, but especially in gaming, tbrpgs, wargaming, and related crafts (such as drawing and programming). As of writing this the only programming lanugage I know is Python 3, and I'm currently trying to learn html5 and css, hence the website. I'm also planning on taking a look at C++, but I probably won't be making anything complex on that in the next few years, as my pc wouldn't be able to handle it (I'm saving up for a better one though ^^). On top of the page you should see a bunch of links (at least once I upload some stuff). They link to different stuff I have done, sorted by craft. It ranges from stuff as simple as card design to stuff as toasty as 3D art. And with toasty I mean the effect it had on my pc. Not that I've ever actually toasted bread with my pc, though that does seem funny. *<i>opens Youtube</i>*. That was actually pretty boring to watch. Oh well. Maybe my stuff won't be as boring *<i>wink wink</i>*</p>
